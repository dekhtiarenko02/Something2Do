1. Exception Handling:
Create custom exception classes (e.g., UserNotFoundException, TaskNotFoundException) to handle specific error cases and provide meaningful error messages.

2. Input Validation:
Validation Annotations: Use @Valid and validation annotations like @NotNull, @Size, etc., in request models to ensure that the input data meets specific criteria before processing.
Implement custom validators where needed, such as checking if a task type is valid or ensuring that task IDs follow a certain format.

3. Security:
Authentication and Authorization: Integrate Spring Security for handling authentication and authorization. Use role-based access control (RBAC) to restrict access to certain endpoints based on user roles.
Rate Limiting: Implement rate limiting to prevent abuse of the API.

4. Logging:
Log Levels: Implement logging using SLF4J or Logback. Log different levels (INFO, DEBUG, ERROR) based on the situation.

5. Database Integration:
Persistent Storage: Replace in-memory storage with a relational database (e.g., PostgreSQL, MySQL) or NoSQL database (e.g., MongoDB) for data persistence.
JPA/Hibernate: Use Spring Data JPA or a similar ORM framework to manage database interactions.

6. Testing:
Unit Tests: Implement unit tests for services, controllers, and utility classes using JUnit and Mockito.
Integration Tests: Create integration tests to ensure that components work together as expected.
Test Coverage: Aim for high test coverage, particularly for critical business logic and error handling.

7. Configuration Management:
Externalized Configuration: Use application.properties or application.yml for managing configuration properties. Externalize environment-specific configurations (e.g., database credentials, API keys).
Configuration Profiles: Use Spring profiles to manage different configurations for development, testing, and production environments.

8. API Documentation:
Swagger/OpenAPI: Integrate Swagger or OpenAPI to automatically generate API documentation. This makes it easier for developers to understand and use your API.
Versioning: Implement API versioning to ensure backward compatibility as your API evolves.

9. Performance Optimization:
Lazy Loading: Use lazy loading for related entities (if using JPA) to avoid loading unnecessary data.

10. Monitoring and Metrics:
Application Monitoring: Integrate monitoring tools like DataDog to monitor application health and performance.
Custom Metrics: Expose custom metrics (e.g., number of tasks completed, task creation rate).

11. Deployment:
Containerization: Dockerize the application to ensure consistency across different environments.
CI/CD Pipeline: Implement a Continuous Integration/Continuous Deployment (CI/CD) pipeline using tools like Jenkins or Bamboo for automated testing and deployment.
